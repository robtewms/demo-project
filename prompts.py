You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Action_Response.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer.

Use Thought to understand the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Action_Response will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:

  }
}
